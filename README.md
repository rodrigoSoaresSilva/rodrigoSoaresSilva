### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have 12 years of experience in software development.
Over the years, I have worked with a wide range of languages, frameworks, and platforms, which has allowed me to develop a strong and versatile skill set.
However, my true passion lies in PHP, where I have cultivated deep expertise and a genuine enthusiasm for creating robust and efficient solutions.
